In order to practice my flexbox knowledge, I selected a challenging layout and reproduced it on a pixel perfect level of detail.

It assured me to understand how each property really works and made me really glad acomplishing such task.

The original layout WAS NOT made by me. I only chose one that would challenge me searching on the internet, since my goal was to practice positioning with Flexbox and not to actually design a layout from scratch.

I didn't really like the smaller breakpoints used on the original template, so I changed it a little bit using flex-basis so that some components would fit better on smaller screens.
